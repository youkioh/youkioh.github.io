        title: CXL Memory Management for Datacenter
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I am currently working on heterogeneous memory management for CXL-based memory systems in datacenter.
          My research focuses on the hotness-aware & timeliness-aware memory management with system software support.
          I am also interested in the performance evaluation of CXL-based memory systems.
